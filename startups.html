            <h2>Idea</h2>
            <p>Everyone who treats their startup with love and high level of responsibility understands that this is hard work and very often it doesn’t pay off. We’ve been there before so many times and we might be there again many times in the future. What we’ve come across is that there was hardly a person who was ready to help us for free when we just started. That is why we’re very grateful to those who’s shared even a single piece of advice and we appreciate so much their help and friendship. That was really precious for us. One especially needs help when they don’t have much experience. A startup is not just a word, it’s planning, marketing, production, sales, support and a lot of other things. The good news is that we already have this experience and we’re ready to share our knowledge for free. Of course most of the time we’re busy with our own projects but we are also eager to help startup newbies with good advice at least, because we remember the time when it was us who were at the very beginning of this difficult path. Feel free to write to us, we’ll be always happy to help. Let’s change this system that enables every person with some experience to consider themselves experts and charge money for a minute of their time. We’re ready to start these changes with ourselves. Good luck to all of you!</p>

We understand that there’re a lot of ideas and today you like your idea and tomorrow you may change your mind. To make sure that our advice will be really helpful for you we have some simple conditions. </p>
